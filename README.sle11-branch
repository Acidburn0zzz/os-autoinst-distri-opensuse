The test cases and needles need to be up to day anyhow and change at
a very high pace.  So we pull in upstream via a separately cloned repo
(on the master branch) and just symlink to that, like so:

git clone https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse master-testcases
ln -s master-testcases/tests tests
ln -s master-testcases/lib lib
ln -s master-testcases/data data

But it doesn't matter where these symlinks point to.
